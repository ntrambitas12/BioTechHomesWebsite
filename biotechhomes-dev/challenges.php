                In the construction industry, there are always risks when it comes to the work site, the employees, and the equipment. Currently, the biggest issues are rising medical costs, a shortage of skilled workers, site security, and contractual problems. Companies have to sign off on these contracts which can be $100k to billions of dollars.

                <p class="color-text-a">
                Getting a permit is one of the most important steps in the process of construction. Unfortunately, permits can be expensive and might take a while to obtain. Many permits are often turned down because there are missing details, inaccurate blueprints, zoning issues, or the designer is simply not qualified for the job.

                </div>
                <p class="color-text-a">
                Some of the most common problems with home associations include, but not limited to. The board either takes to long or fails to notify residents about meetings, which leads up to homeowners paying fees. Repairs are either delayed or cancelled, and unfair treatment when it comes to restrictions and rules.

                <p class="color-text-a">
                In the construction industry, there are often problems with site safety, lack of required skill set, and frequent technical failures. These can lead to endangerment of the workers and setbacks in developments. Technology is also changing constantly, so workers have to learn how to use the new machines.
